## Detailed Findings

### CRITICAL-001: Reentrancy Vulnerability in ETH Transfer Functions

**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed
**CVSS Score**: 9.1 (Critical)

**Description:**
The contract contained reentrancy vulnerabilities in three critical functions that handle ETH transfers:
- `claimTransfer()` (line 126)
- `cancelTransfer()` (line 157) 
- `payInvoice()` (line 284)

These functions used the unsafe `.call{value: amount}("")` pattern without reentrancy protection, allowing malicious contracts to re-enter and potentially drain funds.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
// In claimTransfer()
(bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: transfer.amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");

// In cancelTransfer()  
(bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: transfer.amount}("");
require(success, "Refund failed");

// In payInvoice()
(bool success,) = payable(invoice.recipient).call{value: invoice.amount}("");
require(success, "Payment failed");
```

**Attack Vector:**
1. Attacker creates malicious contract as recipient
2. Attacker initiates transfer to malicious contract
3. When claiming, malicious contract's `receive()` function calls `claimTransfer()` again
4. Reentrancy allows multiple withdrawals before state is updated

**Impact:**
- Complete drainage of contract ETH balance
- Loss of funds for legitimate users
- Contract becomes insolvent

**Remediation:**
Implemented custom reentrancy guard with the following components:

```solidity
// Reentrancy guard state variables
uint256 private constant _NOT_ENTERED = 1;
uint256 private constant _ENTERED = 2;
uint256 private _status;

// Constructor initialization
constructor() {
    _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
}

// Reentrancy protection modifier
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _status = _ENTERED;
    _;
    _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
}
```

Applied `nonReentrant` modifier to all vulnerable functions:
- `function claimTransfer(...) external nonReentrant`
- `function cancelTransfer(...) external nonReentrant`  
- `function payInvoice(...) external payable nonReentrant`

**Verification:**
- Added comprehensive reentrancy attack tests
- Verified all tests pass with protection in place
- Confirmed gas costs remain reasonable (additional ~2,300 gas per protected call)

### HIGH-001: Unsafe ERC20 Token Interactions

**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Fixed
**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)

**Description:**
The contract used unsafe ERC20 token interaction patterns that could fail with non-standard tokens:

1. **Missing Return Value Checks**: Direct calls to `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` without checking return values
2. **Non-Standard Token Compatibility**: Many tokens (like USDT) don't return boolean values
3. **Silent Failures**: Failed transfers could go unnoticed, leading to inconsistent state

**Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
// Unsafe patterns found in multiple locations
IERC20(_tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
IERC20(transfer.tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender, transfer.amount);
IERC20(invoice.tokenAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, invoice.recipient, invoice.amount);
```

**Attack Vector:**
1. Use of malicious or non-standard ERC20 tokens
2. Tokens that return false on failure instead of reverting
3. Tokens that don't return any value (like USDT)
4. Silent failures leading to state inconsistencies

**Impact:**
- Failed token transfers not detected
- Users lose tokens without receiving transfers
- Contract state becomes inconsistent with actual token balances
- Potential for exploitation with malicious tokens

**Remediation:**
Implemented safe ERC20 wrapper functions:

```solidity
/// @notice Safely transfers ERC20 tokens
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
        abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, amount)
    );
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "SafeTransfer: transfer failed");
}

/// @notice Safely transfers ERC20 tokens from one address to another
function _safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
        abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, amount)
    );
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "SafeTransfer: transferFrom failed");
}
```

**Key Safety Features:**
- Checks both call success and return value
- Handles tokens that don't return values (data.length == 0)
- Handles tokens that return false on failure
- Provides clear error messages for debugging

**Verification:**
- Added tests for non-standard ERC20 tokens
- Added tests for failing ERC20 tokens  
- Verified compatibility with standard ERC20 tokens
- All existing functionality preserved
